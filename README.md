# Edit Distances for Matlab

This package provides implementations of the Levenshtein, Damerau- 
Levenshtein, and weighted edit distance for strings as well as key lists 
(i.e. cell arrays of strings).

## Is the code citable? (for research projects)

This code is part of the work described in [1]. In [1], edit distances are 
applied to match linguistic descriptions that occur when referring to objects 
(in order to achieve joint attention in spoken human-robot / human-human 
interaction).
